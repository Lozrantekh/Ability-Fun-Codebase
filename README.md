This code is for people that want to recreate the Dota 2 Fun custom map for themselves and their friends.

Simply follow the normal workshop guides to create a new mod and drop the content and game folder in the newly named mod respectively.
Don't forget to drop the current dota 2 map vpk file into the new mod folder and let it compile.
Afterwards the game mode should function as it did before.
